# TWGT Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a core engineering principle of the TWGT platform.

Every repository is expected to follow secure development practices, protect sensitive information, and support responsible vulnerability management.

---

# Security Principles

- Security by Design
- Least Privilege
- Defense in Depth
- Zero Trust
- Secure Defaults
- Continuous Monitoring
- Responsible Disclosure
- Privacy Awareness

---

# Supported Branches

| Branch | Status |
|---------|--------|
| main | Supported |
| develop | Supported |
| feature/* | Development Only |

---

# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

- Do not disclose it publicly.
- Report the issue privately to the project maintainers.
- Include reproduction steps where possible.
- Allow time for investigation and remediation before public disclosure.

---

# Secure Development

All repositories should:

- Use code reviews.
- Scan dependencies regularly.
- Keep third-party libraries up to date.
- Validate all external input.
- Avoid hard-coded secrets.
- Store secrets using secure secret-management systems.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.

---

# Authentication

Platform services should support:

- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

# Secrets Management

Secrets should never be committed to source control.

Use secure secret-management services such as:

- GitHub Secrets
- HashiCorp Vault
- Cloud Secret Managers

---

# Dependency Management

Repositories should use:

- Dependabot
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Automated dependency updates
- Regular vulnerability scanning

---

# CI/CD Security

Continuous Integration pipelines should include:

- Dependency scanning
- Static code analysis
- Secret scanning
- License validation
- Automated testing
- Build verification

---

# Infrastructure Security

Infrastructure should be managed using:

- Infrastructure as Code
- Immutable deployments
- Network segmentation
- Encrypted communications (TLS)
- Audit logging

---

# Monitoring

Security monitoring should include:

- Authentication events
- API activity
- Infrastructure health
- Audit logs
- Telemetry
- Incident reporting

---

# Compliance

TWGT aims to align with industry best practices for:

- Secure software development
- Data protection
- Operational resilience
- Responsible AI engineering

---

# Continuous Improvement

Security is an ongoing process.

Policies, tooling, and practices should be reviewed regularly as the platform evolves.
